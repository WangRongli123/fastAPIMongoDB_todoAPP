Project Introduction: FastAPI-MongoDB Todo List Application

Project Background
Contemporary task management systems require efficient, scalable solutions with real-time responsiveness. This project utilizes FastAPI - an ASGI-compliant Python framework - paired with MongoDB's document-oriented database architecture to deliver a performant backend system. Serving as both production-ready infrastructure and educational reference, it exemplifies modern REST API development patterns with NoSQL integration while maintaining compliance with industry best practices.

Project Objectives

Implement asynchronous API endpoints leveraging FastAPI's ASGI runtime, optimized for MongoDB's horizontally scalable document store

Establish standardized CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with atomic transaction guarantees

Architect modular components adhering to separation of concerns:

Data modeling (Pydantic BaseModel)

Business logic (API routes)

Presentation layer (response schemas)

Demonstrate robust data validation and serialization workflows using Pydantic v2 conventions

Support deployment flexibility across local MongoDB instances and cloud platforms (e.g., Atlas) via URI configuration

Functional Overview
Core Capabilities

Task Management Engine

Create documents with mandatory fields: name, description, completed, ISO 8601 timestamp

Retrieve operations:

GET all documents with server-side filtering

GET single document by MongoDB ObjectId

Full document replacement via PUT method

Idempotent deletion using MongoDB's atomic find_one_and_delete

Technical Implementation

Database Integration

Official MongoDB Python driver (PyMongo 4.6+)

Automatic BSON/ObjectId conversion handling

Connection pooling with automatic retry policies

API Development Standards

Request validation through Pydantic models

Custom serialization/deserialization layer for:

API-safe ID representation (str vs ObjectId)

Strict datetime formatting

HTTP status code standardization (RFC 9110)

System Architecture

markdown
Three-Tier Structure:
1. Data Layer (`models/`): 
   - Pydantic BaseModel definitions
   - Type annotations for MongoDB document schema

2. Service Layer (`routes/`): 
   - API endpoint handlers
   - Business logic isolation
   - Async database operations

3. Presentation Layer (`schemas/`):
   - Response model definitions
   - Post-processing serialization
   - OpenAPI schema generation
Deployment Flexibility

Pre-configured for:

Local MongoDB instances (mongodb://localhost:27017)

Cloud services via URI modification:

python
MongoClient("mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.xzy.mongodb.net/")
Environment variable support for credential management

Technology Stack Validation

Term	Verified Implementation
ASGI	FastAPI's Uvicorn-based ASGI server
ObjectId	MongoDB's 12-byte unique identifier (BSON type 0x07)
BSON	Native MongoDB document encoding (Binary JSON)
CRUD	REST-compliant HTTP methods: POST/GET/PUT/DELETE
Atomic Operation	MongoDB's findOneAndUpdate/findOneAndDelete
Connection Pooling	PyMongo's built-in connection management
